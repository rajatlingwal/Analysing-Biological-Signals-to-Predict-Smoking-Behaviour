# Analysing-Biological-Signals-to-Predict-Smoking-Behaviour Report Using SAS Tool
# Objective
Our report's objective is to analyse body signals to identify smokers and gain insights. We'll achieve this by using the best statistical methods tailored to our dataset.
The main purpose of accurately distinguishing between smokers and non-smokers is to better understand the link between smoking and various health issues. Smoking is a significant risk factor for diseases like lung cancer, heart problems, and breathing issues. When we correctly identify smokers and non-smokers, it enables researchers to study the impact of smoking on health more precisely. This, in turn, helps in creating effective public health initiatives to reduce smoking rates and prevent health problems.
